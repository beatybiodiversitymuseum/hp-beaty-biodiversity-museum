      “We think of krill as that single pink cloud that moves in balletic undulations across the ocean in nature documentaries, sustenance for some of the largest inhabitants of this earth—baleen whales. But seeing each tiny droplet, with its two black pinprick eyes, lifeless and immobile in a specimen jar, is a very different way to view this keystone species. In an operation inverse but equal to the hi-res images that reveal the billions of stars that make up the Milky Way, it reminds us that ‘amorphous’ and 'anonymous’ are only a matter of perspective (as are their opposites), and that even the tiniest of creatures can make us feel small.”

    “The image of John Davidson’s field kit is a self-contained and artfully composed process narrative. Looking at the trowel, hand lens, plant press, and other neatly arranged tools, we can easily imagine the botanist meticulously collecting, identifying, and pressing his buttercup for subsequent mounting and cataloging. The result of his diligence is a lovely herbarium specimen, preserved for future study.

    Having participated in collection forays with field botanists, I can attest to the fact that the modern-day botanist’s field kit has changed very little since Davidson’s time. The layperson’s field kit I carry when walking through the forest includes a hand lens, knife, jars for dead bugs, and paper lunch bags for collecting edible mushrooms and fern spores (to propagate). I also carry a phone and clip-on macro lens to take photos of plants and other life – today’s responsible collection method for the biologically curious hobbyist.

    We all carry a field kit of sorts, and that’s what gives this image universal appeal. The first punishment I remember receiving as a child of three or four years old happened because I rummaged through my mother’s handbag – her own urban field kit containing everything she needed for obtaining day-to-day goods and services for her family.

    What’s in your field kit?”

    “Whilst visiting friends atop Mount Warburton Pike on Saturna Island in 1982, I found little mushrooms growing on a rotting woollen carpet heaped in their garden. This carpet at one time was sunk with a boat in False Creek for a month, and after salvage served as an outdoor carpet till decay rendered it more suitable as garden mulch. The same Melanotus species was found on discarded blue-jeans, rolled up work socks, seat covers of abandoned cars, furniture upholstery, old hemp rope and a variety of other man-made fibres so it was given the name Melanotus textilis. The designated TYPE specimen was growing on jute-like fabric of an abandoned chair in woods on the Musqueam Indian Reservation near UBC.”

  description: |
    “This specimen is a black and white tegu lizard (Salvator merianae formerly Tupinambis merianae), a species that exhibits a marked circannual cycle of activity that is reflected in their thermal biology. During spring and summer, tegus are active and warm themselves by basking in the sun, retreating to their burrows at night. During most of the autumn and winter, animals retreat completely into burrows where they hibernate without feeding and with minimal activity during the whole season with body temperatures equal to that of the shelter. These lizards can use thermogenesis to sustain an elevated body temperature throughout the reproductive season indicating that ectotherms the size of the earliest mammals are able to engage in a form of reproductive endothermy that may represent the first steps in the evolution of true endothermy.

    This specific tegu arrived in Vancouver as a 10 gram baby shortly after hatch. I brought it back from Brazil where colleagues have a breeding colony. It was raised here and as you can see grew prodigiously. If handled regularly they are very tame. If not they can be very nasty. Judging by the jowls, this one was a male and I believe it had been nick-named Marlon after Marlon Brando.”

    “The Beaty Biodiversity Museum has long been favourite for us. My boys like imaging all the ways each creature/organism met it’s death. While that’s a bit macabre, as my mom would say, ‘such is life.’

    When I was asked to help Beaty celebrate UBC’s 100th birthday, and choose one of 100 'treasures’ to write about I knew right away that I had to choose the passenger pigeon.

    This past week, we visited the museum to meet the pigeon in person. We were brought into an underground room adjacent to the actual museum, and watched as the pigeon drawer was pulled out. Pigeons (and their wings), some as old as two-hundred years, were laid out in front of us. My kids were treating this occasion as if it’s commonplace for us, which it completely is not. We learned that the passenger pigeon is extinct, and the one we saw was from the 1800’s. My kids even got to touch some of the birds in the drawer — a definite highlight of the day.

    “This picture of the Staghorn Coral brought back wonderful memories of a trip my husband and I took to Australia in 1976. We flew by helicopter from Gladstone over the Great Barrier Reef to Heron Island.

    Heron Island is a true coral cay situated in the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef. The World Heritage Listed, Marine National Park is located there. Only thirty acres in size, the Island is surrounded by white sand. At low tide, with the aid of poles, we walked in amongst the beautiful coral to the edge of the island. At high tide we snorkeled around the island and viewed the ocean teeming with colourful tropical fish. We were blessed to have had such a delightful experience.

    During our visit we discovered at the research centre that the coral reef was being attacked by Crown Of Thorn Sea Stars which were doing significant damage to the reef. In recent years rising water temperatures and ocean acidification are also damaging coral reefs around the world.

    Australia has developed the largest Marine Reserve network in the world.

    We hope people will soon learn to respect our oceans and the fascinating creatures like the Staghorn Coral who live there.

    Happy birthday, UBC.”

    “Looking at this collection from over 40 years ago, I can remember exactly where I made it; I can almost still smell the sagebrush! I was with my friend and teacher, the late Sam Mitchell from Xaxl’ep (Fountain). A speaker of the Stl’atl’imx (St’at’imc) Interior Salish language, Sam was an expert in all aspects of his territory. As part of my doctoral research, he was sharing his amazing knowledge of different varieties of Saskatoon berry [(Amelanchier spp.; Klinkenberg 2015)](https://linnet.geog.ubc.ca/DB_Query/QueryForm.aspx?Submit=Submit+Search+Parameters&Genus=&Species=&Subspecies=&Variety=&EnglishName=&Family=&InvStatus=Both&sort=a.Family&f=1&oneword=Amelanchier) called stsekwum, with me. These included: spekpek, ‘white-white’; swelhkwa7-u7sa7 “red-berry”; stl’exel’us “sweet berry”, stsekwum-ul “real/original saskatoon” and, finally, the one in this collection, nek’nakw’-ukw’sa7 “rotten berry”. Each variety had its own characteristics of growth form, habitat, and taste, colour, seed size and juiciness. This one, he explained, had large seeds and tended to rot quickly, so was not very popular.

    Other Interior Salish First Peoples – and some coastal groups – also recognized multiple varieties of the culturally important fruit. I was so fortunate to have been able to document some of these through collaborative botanical research with my Indigenous colleagues, as a way of highlighting the rich ethnobotanical heritage we have here in British Columbia

    “You know, it’s a commonly held misbelief that the plural of octopus is octopi. In fact, the plural is octopuses. ‘pi’ as a suffix is Latin, whilst the root word 'octopus’ is Greek. Apparently it’s an etymological taboo to mix the two.

    They’re exceedingly graceful, octopuses. I was surprised by this when I timidly held a baby octopus several years ago at the Vancouver Aquarium. Anything with eight legs was far too much like a spider, in my mind. But in reality, this was one of the most delicate, elegant animals I’d ever beheld. At full size, I imagine the Giant Pacific Octopus is like a shy, misunderstood monarch, secretly skirting the underwater walls beneath the Sea to Sky highway.”

  description: |
    _Pseudohydnum gelatinosum_ is my favourite fungi to encounter on a fall mushroom walk through the lower mainland’s cool, wet, coastal forests. While most other fungi reflect the earthy tones of an autumnal colour palette, _Pseudohydnum gelatinosum_ is devoid of colour, translucent, filled with the soft light of cloudy skies filtered through hemlock needles. When dried, it is a less impressive specimen: a twisted, tanned skin of itself.

    It is a jelly fungus, and, when fresh, has the texture and appearance of a lump of unflavoured gelatin. It invites you to touch it, the underside is wet velvet formed of innumerable, soft, spore-bearing teeth. One of its more evocative common names is the “cat’s tongue”. It is also known as the “toothed jelly fungus” or—as I learned from this project—the “great spirit gummy bear”. The specimen is a treasure, but the fresh fungus is a jewel for you to go out and discover: the silent tongues in the forest, the teeth that don’t bite, the mythical candy made of Vancouver rain.

    The ‘Speckled Dace’ is a small fish that, in Canada, only lives in the Kettle River. There is a major waterfall (Cascade Falls) just before the US border, and the Kettle River above the Cascade is the only place in Canada where you can find the Speckled Dace. It is not a big fish: the adults range from about 50 to 80 mm, and females are consistently larger than males. Breeding begins in mid-July and extends through August. Breeding females are quite drab but the males put on a colourful display. They develop bright red colours on their lower fins and on their lips. Some old timers call them the 'Lip Stick Fish.'”

  description: |
    “Muskoxen are hulking wanderers, and it is therefore quite suitable for them to make their home in the boundless expanses of one of Earth’s greatest ecosystems - the Arctic tundra. For a muskox, summer begins when he finally descends from barren high grounds to damp river valleys, trading the Arctic willow for the succulent grasses of the lowlands previously laden with deep snow.

    For me, a summer student working in the Cowan Tetrapod Collection, summer began when I helped welcome a new addition to the collection. It would be at least a year before he would go on display and because storage space is tight in a museum like Beaty, the muskox and I bunked together behind the scenes in a cramped curatorial room. As I went about my work arranging bones and photographing bird specimens, I began to realize not only how important my new companion was for the museum, but also for all his kin still roaming wild in the Arctic.

    Muskoxen are masters of the tundra and are some of the few large mammals able to survive every season of this harsh environment. Although management regulations have recently released them from the persecution of two centuries of overhunting, they still face an increasingly more immediate threat – habitat loss due to accelerating climate change. Since the Pleistocene, a changing climate has characterized the contracting range of the muskox. The herds that extended as far south as Kansas 20 000 years ago are now restricted to the northern rim of the continent. While muskoxen no longer roam as far south as the Okanagan valley, such ecological change has been drawn out over thousands of years of natural glacial cycles. Now it is occurring within a single muskox generation.”

    “The botanical illustration is the perfect intersection of art and science, documenting and recording plants and their uses long before the advent of photography. As early as the 1st century BC when Greek physician Cretavas recorded the medicinal use of plants for the Codex Vindobonensis, scientist-artists were tasked to accurately draw and paint botanical specimens. Illustrators were particularly busy during the Age of Exploration, being brought along on naval expeditions across the oceans to log the flora and fauna of these “new worlds.” I work at the Belkin Art Gallery at UBC, where we have works in our collection by the Canadian artist Victor Doray, who began his career as a medical artist and was the founding director of the Department of Biomedical Communications at UBC in 1957. It’s terrific to think that even in the middle of the 20th century, hand drawings were created and valued for more than aesthetic reasons.

    Shaggy Mane mushrooms, which can be found all over campus in the fall, are known as ink caps because they darken as they age and, more significantly, deteriorate quickly after being picked until they liquefy into a pool of inky black fluid. One October while visiting my brother and his family in Armstrong, BC, we came out late from Rosie’s Pub at the Armstrong Hotel and very literally stumbled upon a huge patch of Shaggy Manes. We had coincidentally just been reading about these edible gems in the Pub, which was lined at that time with shelves and shelves of reference books. In the darkness, we found a garbage bag and rather rapaciously harvested the mushrooms, imagining a wonderful soup for Thanksgiving dinner the next evening. In what turned out to be a fortunate event, we forgot the bag of mushrooms on the back porch that night; the next morning, there was nothing left but a river of black ink running down the stairs and into the garden.”

    “The octopus genus _Argonauta_ (often called paper nautiluses) are named after explorers of Greek legends. To me, however, these animals are equal parts classic mythology and futuristic science fiction!

    As a child I often dreamed of being able to fly, and I sometimes wonder of the ancestors of this group felt the same way. Most octopuses are built to live as bottom dwellers – they’re well adapted for crawling on the ocean floor, but they’re poor swimmers. Female paper nautiluses have developed a way to explore other parts of the water column. They can secrete hard, spiral shaped objects that were once thought to be the species’ egg cases. Scientists now believe that these objects are more like ‘ships.’ Paper nautiluses have been observed crawling inside these spirals, tipping them to the surface to trap air inside, and then using them to swim with neutral buoyancy at a variety of depths.

    Male paper nautiluses do not produce these spiral vessels. To increase the chance of fertilizing a floating female, they have evolved detachable penises that can be ‘launched’ into the water and swim independently. Fire the torpedoes!

    As a museum interpreter, I’ve met many people who are passionate about octopuses, but few have ever heard of the Argonaut group and their unusual abilities. I love sharing the unusual story behind this treasure when visitors explore our museum.”

    “Not your usual skunk, the Western Spotted Skunk is BC’s own, occurring nowhere else in Canada. They have the typical black and white colouration like all skunks, a warning to predators that they pack a stinky punch. Less than half the size of the more common Striped Skunk it also has a unique method for spraying. Rather than turning its back end towards a threat it does a handstand and tilts the business end (anal glands) towards the intended target. Thus it keeps the threat in view while getting in a good yoga session. This cute little guy was the unfortunate victim of a snap trap baited for rats but just as attractive to this small carnivore. It caught only his front right paw but his efforts to escape meant there was too much damage for rehabilitation. He was my first Spotted Skunk preparation, the first one the museum received since 1950, and he was nowhere near as stinky as a Striped Skunk.”

    This Vancouver phenomenon began prior to 1897 when 1 or 2 pairs of pet birds probably originally from China were released. The Crested Myna population peaked in 1925 and started to decline in the 1950’s when European Starlings arrived in this city. A micro-industry used to exist of birders coming to Vancouver to see the only North American population of Crested Mynas.

    Irene and Clint Davy called this orphaned bird “Morris the Myna”. After hand-raising him, they consulted with the Vancouver Natural History Society (now Nature Vancouver) as to the best place to release Morris. It was recommended that he not be released because the Vancouver Crested Myna population was close to extinction. After living with Irene and Clint for 21 years, Morris died in his sleep. His death in 2007 was the final curtain on what used to be a Vancouver bird icon.”

Coralline algae are the glue on the reef, binding all the corals and other bits of material together, and coral reefs just wouldn’t be the same without them.

    “Although widely distributed along BC’s coast, the northwestern salamander is a fairly elusive salamander. This relatively large and charismatic salamander is often found hidden at the base of ferns, underneath vegetation and logs, and in burrows. On Vancouver Island I’ve regularly encountered western red-backed salamanders and rough-skin newts while exploring coastal forests, but I’ve rarely encountered the much larger northwestern salamander. More often, I’ve come across their beautiful, globular, gelatinous egg-masses stuck to fallen branches in rainforest streams. In fact, thousands of tourists from around the world look in wonder each year at some very prominent egg-mass blobs of this species along the popular Big Trees Trail on Meares Island near Tofino, at a heavily traversed stream-crossing along the famous old-growth forest boardwalk trail. However, few tourists realize quite what they are looking at – that the impressive egg-masses will eventually become equally impressive adult northwestern salamanders, complete with swollen poison glands behind their eyes.”

    “Queen Victoria collected seaweed. So did a lot of other Victorians, both in Britain and North America. Keeping with the Victorian fascination of collecting and a cataloging the natural world, men and women combed the shores, carefully pressing algae into scrapbooks for both science and mementos.

    This scrapbook by Emily Brand is a beautifully rendered example of just such an endeavor. On textured paper bound by aging ribbons, Brand pressed and mounted a wide range of algal specimens, painted a watercolour landscape on the title page, and carefully inscribed the popular poem ‘Sea Mosses,’ by New England poet Clara B. Heath (b. 1831).

    Seaweed collecting was not as popular as pressing flowers, but it held social, scientific, and spiritual meaning for the collector: such a collection demonstrated patience, artistic talent, a refined sensibility for the subtle beauty of nature, as well as improving one’s scientific knowledge, while deepening the appreciation of the what was commonly seen as God’s creations.

    I’ll close with another verse from that poem, evoking the delightful mix of the sentiments of the Victorian times, blending nymphs and mermaids, with science, nature, and the notion that a single God was ever-present, just behind the scenes. This scrapbook is truly a specimen of its time.

    Was this the fringe of a sea-nymph’s robe,
    Caught in the door of a coral cave,
    Loosened by waters that span the globe,
    And tossed ashore on a foamy wave?

    ...

    Are these the strands of a carpet soft,
    Richer than mortal has ever trod,
    Freed by the current and borne aloft,
    To show us the hidden work of God?
    - from 'Sea Mosses,’ by Clara B. Heath, 1881”

    “The inconspicuous whorl of a graptolite hieroglyph, shiny like a Paleozoic pencil sketch, is the “writing on the rock” so named in Greek. Like messengers from deep time, they are used as index fossils to date rock beds. The fixed spiral that today we see and interpret was once inhabited by a cooperative colony of zooid architects that built their delicate skeletal home to float and feed in the ancient seas, a feat accomplished by the division of labour among the individuals. I came across this particular graptolite-cooperative when involved in a project to clean and catalogue the vast mess of the Beaty fossil collection. This was the favourite fossil of my fellow volunteer and fossil enthusiast David Turner. We remarked on the whimsy of returning the creature to the water under the tap, after so many years of thirst, and then of entering its vitals into the computer matrix of the fossil catalogue. I felt the strange lick of time.”

    “Spiders. What a cringe-worthy subject. The worst is walking in the backyard of my apartment on a warm summer afternoon. Trying to avoid a spider web only to walk right into yet another.

    So why jumping spiders?

    ***

    I first met my boyfriend at a common friend’s birthday party. Maybe I "accidentally” took his beer. And then we spent the night dancing together. His move? Raising his arms up and down, and occasionally stepping to the right, and then left.

    Okay, fine. He is not the best dancer. But somehow that left an impression.

    ***

    It was not until a few months later that I found out he is a fan of nature documentaries. Through him, I learnt about these fascinating little guys, jumping spiders. With eight massive, hypnotizing eyes drawing your closer. Then, unannounced, launching toward the prey, a surprise attack.

    But, they are also known for their skills in picking up mates, showing off all the dance moves when it comes to attracting the opposite sex. They wave their forelegs up and down, a few steps to the right, and then left.

    Wait a minute. Wasn’t that how my boyfriend was dancing when we met?

    ***

    Perhaps - it was the jumping spider I have fallen in love with?“

    “Affectionately called ‘Stumpy’ by museum staff and volunteers this magnificent western red cedar slab is one of the treasures of the Beaty Museum. While it has been part of the museum’s collection for the past 5 years, it has been a feature of UBC campus for more than half a century, spending time in the Biological Science building before arriving at the Beaty. The tree itself is believed to 775 years old when it was felled in the 1950’s. [More information on Stumpy’s life at UBC.](https://news.ubc.ca/2003/09/04/archive-ubcreports-2003-03sep04-stumpy/)

    The Beaty’s collection of authentic objects makes the museum special and putting people in touch with these real specimens is a key part of our approach to teaching and learning. The impressive size and irresistibly tactile nature of this centuries old Western red cedar makes it a real treasure and valuable educational resource. Stumpy plays an important role in engaging our visitor’s hands, hearts and minds - inspiring young and old to feel the wood grain and rough bark, to count the tree rings, contemplate Stumpy’s long life, and reflect on their own lives and relationship with the natural world.”

  description: |
    “Resembling a medallion made of clay covered with "fingerprints”, this fossil called Nummulite, is an example of a fossil giant foraminiferan or foram (a type of amoeba). The “fingerprints” that one sees on this specimen are actually the numerous coils that make up the skeleton or shell of a relatively large single-celled organism. Most forams are microscopic organisms that are no bigger than a pinhead, but Nummulite was a button-sized giant that could be seen with the naked eye. The size and shape of these fossil organisms earned them their scientific name which is derived from the Latin word for ‘little coin’, nummulus. It is no surprise that ancient Egyptians, who were using the rock that contain these fossils to build their Great Pyramids, treated these fossils as a form of currency. These fossils are also equally as valuable to geologists and paleontologists who use them as key index fossils, as certain species of Nummulite are found only in rock layers of a specific known geologic age.“

    “If you heard that there were “stone bugs” in the towering mountains nearby would you go take a look? Richard McConnell collected the very first trilobite fossils from Mount Stephen in 1886 after hearing these rumours and in 1887 he published a report on his discovery of the well-preserved fossils of soft-bodied marine organisms – that just happened to live in Cambrian seas 505 million years ago!

    In 1909, after reading McConnell’s report, American scientist, paleontologist and Secretary to the Smithsonian Institution, Charles Walcott came to Canada and discovered millions of trilobites himself in an area he named the Burgess Shale. Within it lies one of the planet’s most ancient ecosystems, frozen in time in what is now BC’s Yoho National Park. If you’re up for a daylong hike (21kms long and gaining 825 meters in elevation), Parks Canada offers tours up to the Burgess Shale where you can walk among trilobite fossils in this epic UNESCO World Heritage Site.”

This is one of them—a wingless female of a rarely-encountered, nocturnal velvet ant. Velvet ants aren’t really ants; but like ants they are a type of wasp. The Okanagan Valley is at the northern tip of the great steppes of the American west, and is consequently home to many plants and animals found nowhere else in Canada.”

    “This tray of bones of the extinct Great Auk was the first specimen I handled at the museum. My task was to move it from a display case to a room for examination. I was all nerves; I imagined all of the possible ways I could muck up the task, fearing the terrible impression I would make on the museum’s Director and curatorial staff if I damaged these irreplaceable objects in any way.

    Naturally, I executed the task with great care. I thoroughly washed and dried my hands, lifted the tray slowly, and walked in an exaggeratedly smooth manner, trying to float the bones down the hall, breathing a sigh of relief when I placed the tray down safely at its destination. I wished for a moment that the care I took in that act could somehow be retroactively applied to a time before the birds’ extinction.

    Luckily, the very same building that preserves these bones is also a place that applies that care proactively every day. Whether through research, displays, or educational programs, it is the tireless work of these dedicated people that both inspires us and empowers us with the knowledge it takes to put this care into practice.”

It really is a wonder that modern Homo sapiens have been able to create museums, excavate and preserve things like this dinosaur egg for future generations, and to come to the conclusion that Nature is nothing but a small sample of Universal wonders ready for us to discover.”

    “Who wouldn`t be fascinated by a fish so oily that when dried and fitted with a wick it can be used as a candle? Or a fish so enigmatic that it can just disappear from long established spawning locations? Or a fish so mysterious that even its name is ambiguous?

    The history and biology of eulachon, Thaleichthys pacificus, are intriguing. Among other names, eulachon are known as oolican, ooligan, hooligan, saviour or salvation fish and candlefish. They are a type of smelt, a small silvery anadromous fish, and are found only along part of the Pacific coast of North America.

    Eulachon have always had special cultural significance in BC, and were used for many purposes. They were often the first fresh food source available in the spring, and both the fish and their prized grease were used as trade items throughout the province.

    Their limited range and persnickety nature make eulachon a prime candidate for population decline, and in fact they have faced a coastwide decline for many generations. Eulachon are currently considered endangered in many parts of their range. Although their populations are defined by freshwater spawning location, this elusive little fish spends more than 95% of its life in the ocean. It is challenging to determine the causes of population declines and disappearances when we cannot track them for most of their life span.

    We have yet to solve the many mysteries of the eulachon.

    “Seeing this warthog specimen always brings a smile to my face. Its disproportionally large head, wattled face, tufted tail, and corpulent body supported by spindly legs, give it a rather comical appearance – one that Disney animators so humorously interpreted in the character of Pumbaa in the Lion King. When visiting the Serengeti Plains in Kenya in 2011, I had the opportunity to see warthogs in their natural habitat. It was very difficult to observe them at close range because they, more than the other animals, were exceedingly skittish. At the slightest movement they would sprint away at surprising speed. The skull specimens of these creatures are, in contrast, hauntingly beautiful having two pairs of elegantly curved tusks. In life, these would be used for digging, defense and mate competition.”

    “In 1911, our Canadian Department of Agriculture sold this seed collection for $2.00 to help seed merchants and agriculturalists to identify this type of material. We do not know how many of these seed collections were made at that time, nor how many still exist, but the one shown here is housed at the University of British Columbia, and as it was donated by William S. Hill-Tout to the UBC Botany Herbarium on January 11th, 1955.

    “People bought this collection to help them identify seeds. Today collections are just as important to enable accurate identification as they were then, especially in areas such as Agriculture and Control of Borders. The only difference is that today we need accurate identification to support national and international laws, to prevent losses in the billions of dollars, and there is much more that needs to be identified. Today this identification job utilizes a Canada-wide network of collections and libraries in museums and research centres along with their associated experts.

    “Where could you find a 100 year old seed today, other than in a collection like this one? From these seeds we can study the past atmosphere, or even reactivate DNA of a crop that has long since disappeared. We may rediscover medicinal properties. Biological collections are now understood to have enormous value, much more now than at the time when this collection was made.”

    Gisèle Mitrow, Collections Manager, DAO Herbarium

    <hr>

    “This collection shows the importance of agricultural seed-saving over 100 years ago; as we lose diversity in our crop species, scientists and farmers can access these preserved seed collections as valuable resources. Thankfully, we are again recognizing the value of seed saving as a social imperative.

    “I love that collectors included ‘Economic and Weed Seeds’, appreciating the value of plants as not purely financial. This pleasantly surprises me coming from a government department: in the current political and financial climate government scientists might struggle to justify making and saving such a collection.

    “When I look at the names of the so-called 'weed’ seeds, I recognize plants that are perhaps better-known to the Indigenous communities as natural healing and medicinal plants used over the generations. #68 – Lamb’s Quarters, # 82 – Evening Primrose and # 90 – Plantain, for example. #88 “Heal -All” sums it up.

    “I appreciate that the Dept of Agriculture of the day took the time to save these seeds, even though they may not have fully understood the value. Hence the key importance to preserving biological specimens: you don’t know what you don’t know, but future generations just might.”

    “'A giant bluefin tuna, among the largest and most magnificent of animals, hung suspended for a long, riveting moment, emblazoned and backlit like a saber-finned warrior from another world, until its six hundred pounds of muscle crashed into the ocean like a boulder falling from the sky.’ – Carl Safina, Song for the Blue Ocean.

    I have been in love with the ocean and its creatures since I was a little girl, but it was not until I read this paragraph in the second year of my undergrad that I first learned about Atlantic bluefin tuna. These remarkable fish quickly became my favourite. They are warm-blooded, can grow to more than two metres in length, and can accelerate as fast as a sports car. However, since their red flesh is among the most expensive and coveted delicacies in the global sashimi market, commercial fishing has significantly reduced populations of all three bluefin species since the 1970s. Now, they are now also among of the most endangered fish in the sea.

    I know most people will not fall in love with bluefin tuna in the same way I have, but the good news is that everyone still has the ability to make educated and responsible decisions about the seafood they eat. Sure, it takes a little effort, but if it means keeping bluefin—keeping any fish—in the ocean for generations to come, then I think it’s a pretty worthwhile effort to make.“

    “More than 360 million years ago, a dead lamprey sank down onto the seabed and was buried by layers and layers of sand, which eventually hardened into rock. Why this particular lamprey’s cartilage was preserved so well is unknown, but humans were able to discover it and prove that lampreys lived that long ago.

    They still are. They and hagfish, also primitive eel-like cartilaginous fishes, make up Cyclostomata, the jawless fishes. They were the first vertebrate chordates, chordates with backbones (like us!) instead of a notochord, to evolve.

    Although most people who know what they are think they’re creepy, I actually really like them, because they haven’t, unlike us, changed very much from our common ancestor hundreds of millions of years ago. Also, they go back to their birthplace to spawn, just like salmon, and even build a nest.

    Did you know? In Chinese, lampreys are called “eight eyed eel” because of their seven external gill slits plus their eyes! What a tongue twister!”

    “When I was five, I really loved mushrooms. I loved them so much, I took a bright red toadstool home from kindergarten. I put it in my snack bag. I cried when my mom threw it in the garbage. I used to kick over every mushroom I saw. I believed that it would help their spores fly around and make new mushrooms. Each time I saw a mushroom, I would go and kick it over – even if it was in someone’s yard or across the street.

    My favorite mushrooms were like the one on which this Hypocrea pulvinata is growing. There was a small forest near my elementary school, and these little shelf-like mushrooms peppered the tree trunks. I would collect fallen berries, nuts, twigs, leaves, and rocks and display them on the little mushroom shelves, and admire them until the bell rang.

    I couldn’t bear to kick over my favorite forest fungi, so I put it off until the last day of elementary school, five years ago. As I knocked them all off their trees, I felt excited that the whole forest would be full of shelf-mushrooms one day.

    I went back last week. The forest is much smaller now. There are no more fungal shelves.”

Every muscle, organ, bone and sense that we have, so do they but within a three inch, four gram body. The task of keeping these complex bodily functions going but with so little surface area to keep them warm, means their life is short and intense.

    “Every fall, rambling through woods and fields, and even my own backyard, I’m amazed to discover, yet again, the diversity of the fungal world. This time of year, fungi seem to pop up everywhere. And what a surprising range of shapes, sizes, colours, and textures they come in! These natural wonders must have struck a deep chord with the pioneering 19th century US mycologist, J.B. Ellis. For the study and collection of fungi became his life’s passion.”

    With no formal training as a scientist, Ellis began, in 1878, ‘the distribution of a most important series of volumes containing authentic specimens of the fungi of North America.’ Working with his wife, Arvilla, and later, with colleagues such as B.M. Everhart, Ellis organized and prepared these reference sets, known as centuries (each one contained 100 fungal samples) and sent them to subscribers. Many botanists then 'availed themselves of the opportunity here afforded of securing excellent specimens of all groups of the fungi.’ An article published in 1898 in Science provides more background, and indicates that the works, prepared between 1878 – 1898, contained some 270,000 specimens!

    Here at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum, we are lucky to have a set of specimens from the 2nd edition of Ellis and Everhart’s North American Fungi. The series, referred to as 'Fungi Columbiani,’ dates from 1894. Recently, Olivia Lee, from the museum’s herbarium, helped me to avail myself of the 'opportunity here afforded.’ As Olivia opened up the collection box, we found various treasures nestled between fragile papers, tucked into hand-folded envelopes (perhaps prepared by Mrs. Ellis herself!). We were intrigued how sample #204 (Polyporus hirsutus), collected by L.W. Nuttall in W. Virginia 'on dead limb of deciduous tree’ resembled turkey tail fungi found locally. And we marveled at how sample #205 (Polyporus cinnabarinus) still retained its intense cinnamon colour and felty texture. A yellowed pamphlet listed names of all 406 specimens included in the series. There was also a letter from Ottawa’s National Museum, dated 1963, which explained the transfer of the specimens to Dr. Wilfred Schofield at UBC.

    For me, the mystery and beauty of these fungal specimens, along with learning about their history and the stories of the people associated with their discovery make spending time at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum such a wondrous experience. These museum treasures provide an amazing link to the past and also inspire me to learn more about my own backyard.“

    “John Macoun was the first person to collect this elusive liverwort, purportedly in 1889, near Hastings Mill, somewhere in the vicinity of present day Gastown. Because most of the suitable habitat in the area was lost due to subsequent urbanization, the precise location of Macoun’s collection remains unknown. Later efforts of others to relocate the species within the Vancouver area have failed, and some have wondered if Macoun’s gatherings had truly come from the Hastings Mill area in the first place.

    “This beautiful Golden V kelp, Aureophycus aleuticus, was discovered in 2006 in the Islands of Four Mountains in the most north western part of Alaska in the Aleutian Islands, which it was named after. This species can grow to 9 feet long, and has such unique morphology and DNA, it was placed in its own unique family of kelp, the Aureophycaceae. It was described as new-to-science in 2008 and has provided scientists with a better understanding of the evolution of ocean kelp and in 2013 this species was a runner-up of the top 100 new species of the 21st century.”

    “Townsend’s vole is one of the larger-bodied species of meadow voles in North America. When I came to UBC in 1970 we began a study of their population changes, since many species of meadow voles fluctuate in 3-4 year cycles. My graduate students and I studied local populations at the Haney Forestry reserve and at Boundary Bay on the old airfield (that was then inactive) as well as at Reifel Island adjacent to the Reifel Waterfowl Reserve. We found strong population changes from year to year but did not have enough long-term data to find out if they were truly cyclic. We found in doing this work that these large (to 85 grams) voles would not enter live capture traps until the traps were left locked open in the field for a few weeks and they got used to them. So we left the traps out all the time, locked open when we were not live trapping and releasing them. Our most significant finding was that this species is highly territorial and closely-related females (sisters) would bring up their young in the same nest, and jointly defend it against other voles intent on infanticide. The vole world is not peaceful to be sure, and aggression between animals is very common. These voles form an important part of the food web in the grasslands remaining in the Fraser Valley, since overwintering raptors that migrate here from northern Canada feed on them during the winter months, and great blue herons feed on them all year round. They typify the life history stragegy of "mature young, breed often, and die young.”

  description: |
    “This peahen, of the green Southeast Asian Pavo muticus species is notable (unlike her famous blue peafowl relations in India), for being almost as beautiful as the males of her species. Her coverts or ‘train’ may not be as long but she is certainly as regal and as iridescent as any preening male.

    Peafowl have been enduring symbols for millennia: their likeness has adorned Byzantine mosaics, Roman urns, Japanese scrolls and woodblock prints, Dutch paintings, Victorian wallpaper, haute couture fashion, napkin holders and weather vanes. Of course it isn’t only the peafowl’s likeness that has been rendered aesthetic but the bird’s plumage – used in hats, fascinators, fans and even, in the nineteenth century, as decoration on ornate peacock-shaped Indian lutes.

    There are a variety of cultural readings as to what peafowl symbolize: in Indian poetry the bird was a metaphor for courtship, in early European art they symbolized ‘renewal’ (this, in part, because peacock feathers shed naturally and then grew back each spring).

    I think this particular bird (a domestic peahen donated after death by her keeper) reflects some of the traits that make peafowl so alluring: exceptionalism and extraordinary and improbable beauty. Like many species Pavo muticus suffers from habitat destruction and hunting. They are officially listed as Endangered.”

    “This display of egg shells makes me smile each time I see it. It is a clear physical demonstration of what I find so fascinating about evolution: that the process of ‘survival of the fittest’ leads not to one simple outcome but to diversity, here diversity in egg size.

    The tiny egg is that of a hummingbird. After 2-3 weeks, a tiny hummer emerges from such eggs, weighing less than a dime.

    The biggest egg is that of an elephant bird. The cracks in this shell give a clue that the egg shell was actually pieced back together. Elephant birds no longer exist — they went extinct ~300 years ago through over-hunting. Pieces of this egg shell were found in an old pile of food waste (a 'midden’) and glued back together. Elephant birds lived on Madagascar and were about 3 meters tall and 500 pounds — look around, that’s about the size of the museum cabinets!

    While elephant bird eggs are thought to be the largest bird eggs that ever evolved, their size is perhaps not so surprising: the moms were HUGE!! Ditto for small hummingbird eggs: their moms were TINY!! Perhaps the most surprising egg in the world is that of the kiwi. Poor kiwi moms, their eggs can be up to ¼ of their body weight, That would be like a human mom giving birth to a 15kg baby. Ouch!

    Before leaving the topic of egg diversity, the shiny brown tinamou egg is also special. Tinamou eggs come in a variety of colours, depending on the exact species: green, blue, brown. The blue eggs of the great tinamou (Tinamus major) even seem to change colour and are iridescent! Much better than any of the eggs that we’ve ever dyed!

    Why all this diversity? Certainly flightless birds, including elephant birds, ostriches, and kiwis, can carry heavier eggs because they don’t need to fly. But why so big, or so small, or so colourful? Scientists are still trying to figure out the exact details. But for now, we can look at this display and be reminded of the diversity of life that has evolved on earth.”

We spend many a day peeking in the windows to see what we can see in the far reaches of the closed cabinets and cupboards of the Beaty, in the back corner of a lower shelf we were thrilled to discover the Northern Elephant Seal (Mirounga angustirostris). Incredibly the northern elephant seal is a quick moving giant and this being a bull seal it could have weighed up to 2300kgs and 4-5m. in length. These creatures have adapted to deep-sea fishing and have been known to hunt 300 to 800 meters below the surface. This hunting is only possible due to the high content of blood in the seal’s body that helps to store oxygen, males have been known to be underwater for up to 2 hours. This majestic creature once hunted to near extinction (20 left alive) has now bounced back to over 100,000 due to protection. We hope to travel to see the northern elephant seal in its habitat in BC.”

    “The Coho Salmon is a modestly-sized anadromous oncorhynchid that lives within the North Pacific rim of Asia and North America. Its life history involves a protracted freshwater phase, before going to sea, often living out its early existence in small streams, sloughs, beaver ponds and lake margins before emigrating to salt water as a smolt. Its marine period is usually about a year-and-a-half long before coming back to its natal watershed to spawn. In southwestern British Columbia, the Coho Salmon lives in the same lowland, mild-climate, valley-bottom ecosystems that we as humans use. Thus, Coho Salmon is a species of fish that provides us with a perfect indicator of our footprint impact in this part of our Province; its profound drop in population numbers, since European settlement, reflects the major, negative changes that we humans have done to our landscape in British Columbia.”

    “I had the opportunity to develop some recipes while using clams. The goal was to develop some recipes in the classic Italian style using simple fresh ingredients, which would allow the freshness and the flavours of the clams to shine through. Preparing them was a great experience because I had the opportunity to develop them in my home kitchen when my daughter was very young. She experienced the flavour of fresh clams steamed and served with pasta for numerous snacks, lunch and dinners throughout the week. As the aroma’s grew in the house my daughter would come into the kitchen and sit at the breakfast bar and wait for a little taste. She would grab a chunk of bread to dip it in the sauce to taste, and we would share it together making any adjustments required to ensure the dish tasted great.

    Here is the recipe for Linguine with Clams in a white wine sauce:
    - 1 pound clams (in shell) rinsed clean (they must be allowed to purge the sand from their system or they will be gritty)
    - 1 oz. vol. extra virgin olive oil
    - 1 tbsp. – fresh chopped garlic
    - ½ tsp red chili flakes
    - ¼ tsp. salt
    - 1/8 tsp pepper
    - 4 oz. vol white wine (Pinot Grigio works well) – light crisp
    - 8 oz. raw wt. Linguine ( cooked to package directions in boiling salted water) – use your favourite brand DeCecco works well
    - 10 grape tomatoes – cut in half
    - 2 tbsp. – chopped Italian parsley
    - 1 tbsp. unsalted butter

    1 - Place a sauté pan on the burner and heat over a medium high flame.
    2 - Add oil, garlic, chili peppers and sauté for 30 seconds. Add clams to pan, season with salt and pepper and lightly toss, cover pan and allow clams to steam for approx. 2 minutes. Be careful not to move around the pan to much and break the shells. The clams should be starting to open.
    3 - Cook your pasta to the package directions. Reserve some of the pasta water to the side – you may need this at the end of the dish to create the sauce
    4 – Uncover the pan add white wine and cut grape tomatoes, lightly toss and cover clams again for 3 minutes.
    5 - Uncover pan reduce heat – check to see that all clams are opened. Do not force open clams. Any that are not opened discard and do not use. Remove clams using a slotted spoon and place in a warm bowl on the side.
    6 – Add butter to the pan and swirl around to create a sauce, add a little pasta water to the pan if you feel you need a little more liquid. Add pasta to the pan and toss with parsley – place clams back in dish and toss lightly to combine.
    7 – Serve for your guest with a nice bottle of chilled Pinot Grigio.

Yet many First Nations learned how to carefully prepare the plant as a medicine. Today, it isn’t only the danger that thrills me when I see a corn lily—it’s also the secrets it might teach us.”

    “This specimen resonates with me on many levels. First of all, the desert ecosystem found in the Osoyoos area is a national treasure in terms of biological diversity: many of our rarest species can be found there. In fact it has the dubious honour of being among the top three most endangered ecosystems in Canada. Although this particular specimen is from a protected area, the region in general needs much more habitat set aside to protect this biological diversity.

    Secondly, I also work at a museum, and know the value of type specimens. They are essential to the science of describing new species, and housing them is one of the critical roles of natural history museums worldwide.

    Thirdly, Dr. Geoff Scudder is a well-known expert in the study of Hemiptera (the true bugs), and he devoted both his career and even retirement to the identification and study of this interesting group of insects, including those housed at both the Beaty and the Royal BC Museum. It is his expertise that has provided both institutions with exceptionally well-curated collections.

    And last but not least: I grew up in the Thompson-Okanagan and miss the scent of sage, the rolling hills dotted with Ponderosa Pines, and the song of the Western Meadowlark. When I look at this specimen all of these memories come flooding back.”

    “Not all impressive creatures come in grand sizes like the elephant. Take the rufous hummingbird. Despite being one of the smallest birds to fly our skies at just over 3 inches long, it happens to be one of the fastest and feistiest, being very protective of its territory. It sometimes chases away larger-sized animals like chipmunks. Perhaps it is because of the ability and willingness to take on big challenges despite its small stature, it is depicted in some of our stories as an inspirational leader. A few years ago I came across a First Nations folktale retelling called The Little Hummingbird by Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas. The titled protagonist shows courage, resilience, and strength bringing water drop by single drop in an endeavour to extinguish a forest fire. The hummingbird does this while all the other bigger animals look on and lament about why they cannot do anything about their burning home. "I’m doing everything I can.” says she. No matter what your size, you are significant and you can make a difference. That is what the little and hugely impressive hummingbird has taught me.“

    “I learned to scuba dive in a swimming pool in Saskatchewan- why you might ask? Although I was raised in the prairies and my early dives were in prairie lakes (often with only 5 feet of visibility) it was only the beginning of my exploration below the blue line.

    My grandmother lived in an apartment near the ocean in Vancouver and as a child I began to wonder where the crabs, prawns, flounder and salmon I had on my dinner plate came from. The answer began to unfold in the late 1970’s when I started scuba diving in the Georgia Strait.

    For me, that world then became a three dimensional potpourris of life, colour, shape and diversity. At times I would see a trail of disturbed sand. The cause was a flat fish about 45 cm long with both of its eyes on one side of its body, a Starry Flounder. It didn’t start life that way. When it is young it swims around like a normal fish. Over time it starts to tilt, eventually lying and swimming on one side. As part of this metamorphosis both eyes migrate to the top side. The bottom scales become white or cream coloured and the top stays a grey or brown to blend in with the environment. The name Starry Flounder comes from the shape of its scales.

    When you look out over the ocean, try to imagine the wonderment of the diversity and adaptability of life below the blue line. We need to continue to work on understanding that diversity and adaptability- something to behold and protect.”

    “I’m not exactly sure when or where my interest in Oreamnos americanus, more commonly know as Mountain Goat, came from, but it’s hard not to be intrigued by this majestic animal when you’re eye to eye with it at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum.

    This specimen, a female, known by the bend in the horns at the tip, was collected on September 15, 1907 in Banff, Alberta by Major A.C. Brooks at 1800 feet above sea level. Mountain goats prefer steep rocky terrain within alpine and subalpine areas and are the largest mammals found in the high-altitude habitats. With a thick white wooly double coat made up of a fine dense undercoat and an outer long-hair hollow coat, mountain goats are able to withstand temperatures as low as -46 °C. Having recently driven through the Alberta and British Columbia Rockies, I can attest to the need for a nice coat to stay warm while touring the backcountry.

    As you look into the eyes of the specimen at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum, for a moment you get the feeling you’re back to 1907 on a cold fall evening - the wind blows beneath your feet and you pull your jacket tighter to keep yourself warm.”

The highly aquatic amphibian ranges in colour, from a Kermit green to a dark brown, and has striking gold coloured eyes. Its body is designed to spend much of its life underwater, making these little guys excellent at hiding and difficult at seeking. Biologists often have to rely on detector dogs trained to pick up the particular scent of the Oregon spotted frog to locate individual frogs.

    This precious frog is now the most endangered amphibian in Canada, with only three breeding populations left in British Columbia. Their decline is largely linked to the loss of over 86% of wetlands in the Fraser Valley – a large majority of which have been drained for human purposes, including agriculture and urban development.

    The Oregon spotted frog is the ‘canary in the coal mine’ for ecosystem wetlands, changing climates and the growing numbers of wildlife that are threatened in British Columbia. It is a part of the fabric of BC’s natural heritage, but it is also one of the 1900 species at risk in a province with no endangered species legislation. Without a legal safety net to enforce protection and recovery of critical habitat, this precious frog will continue to slip from our sight.

    “Species of Megarhyssa belong to the parasitic wasp family Ichneumonidae in the order Hymenoptera. Females use their very long ‘stinger’ or ovipositor, to lay eggs in the galleries of wood wasp larvae (Hymenoptera of the family Siricidae or horntails) that live deep in the trunks of trees. Once the eggs hatch, the Megarhyssa larva kills and consumes the wood wasp larva, pupates within the tree, and then emerges as an adult wasp. Because wood wasps damage trees, Megarhyssa species are considered beneficial. The length and flexibility of their ovipositor means that they cannot sting humans, although they could bite, if threatened. If one includes the ovipositor, Megarhyssa species are the longest wasp species in the world (up to 16 cm in length - the body alone can be up to 4 cm in length)! There is one species of Megarhyssa in British Columbia: M. nortoni (Cresson) that can be found throughout the summer, hunting around coniferous trees for their hosts. Every summer, people send specimens or photos of these very large wasps to me for identification and are usually amazed that insects this large are found in Canada.”

    “To me, all lilies evoke memories of my mother’s garden. Noting this specimen was collected by John Davidson also connects me to the past, as he was the first director of my workplace, UBC Botanical Garden. But, the story I most want to share is more whimsical than nostalgic; I am part of a friendly competition among plant enthusiasts to find the Columbia lily with the most blossoms. So far, most of us have observed plants with flowers numbering in the mid- to high-20s, but the Flora of North America asserts that plants may occasionally have up to 45 blossoms! The search goes on…”

    “Easter Island is often the star of history lessons on environmental destruction, lest the past repeat itself, and it nearly did. Since 2010, I have been following the scientific expeditions documenting the impact of over-fishing in the island’s waters. While coral flourished, fish larger than one’s palm were rarely seen among the reefs. Recently at the 2015 Our Oceans Conference, Chile announced it would create a 600,000 sq km aquatic sanctuary. The marine park will protect this near-pristine bastion of ocean wildernesses and set Easter Island on a new course in the history books as a global leader in conservation, ensuring its petroglyphs and preserved specimens are not the final record of this vibrant ecosystem.”

    “It is mid July, 1961. The scene is a rolling subalpine meadow somewhere on the upper slopes of Battle Mountain in Wells Gray Provincial Park. The day is cold, raw, overcast, and threatening rain. Near the edge of the meadow two human forms, clad in heavy rain gear, can be seen moving slowly about on hands and knees. From time to time one of them pauses, removes a note book from a pocket, then quickly writes something down. Most of the time, however, their hands, when free, are waving around in the air, constantly swatting at the clouds of mosquitoes now gathered around them. Meet Teuvo Ahti and Leena Hämet-Ahti …on their honeymoon.

    Although Teuvo and Leena are no strangers to western North America, home for them is actually Helsinki, Finland. Coming of age in Finland during World War II would not have been easy; perhaps it was this that instilled in both of them a love of wild green places far removed from the Sturm und Drang of human politics.

    In following decades, one or both of them would return to the west many times. By their own reckoning, the Ahtis have assembled 10,500 plant specimens from western North America. These specimens are now housed in the Botanical Museum of the University of Helsinki (H) – with duplicates at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and the Canadian Museum of Nature (CANL). Taken together, their collections certainly represent the largest extra-North American collection of western plants ever assembled. The only rival collection would be that the Swedish botanist of Eric Hultén.”

    “There is something incredibly captivating and humbling about the horseshoe crab. Commonplace to the point of seeming mundane, they are ancient creatures that have been on Earth two hundred times longer than the human species, with origins dating back as far as the beginnings of animal life!

    Deceptively simple on the surface, what is revealed when you look under their shells, is remarkable. Their natural features include ten eyes, five pairs of walking legs, a heart half the length of their bodies, and baby blue blood that can save a person’s life. As someone who spends a lot of time thinking about creative technology, I’m blown away by the intricacy and innate extensibility of the crab’s form features.

    Built for survival, they have been through four extinctions, and will probably continue to exist far beyond the limits of human civilization. If horseshoe crabs could speak, think of the amazing stories they could share!”

    “When I see birds, I see dinosaurs. And that’s because birds aren’t just descended from dinosaurs, they ARE dinosaurs. Similarly to how humans are a specialized type of primate, birds are specialized type of dinosaur, and THAT IS AWESOME. It means that we have a contemporary reference point to better understand what is—almost inarguably—the most popular group of animals to have ever graced the planet. We’re starting to discover that so many of our favorite dinosaurs had feathers, including Velociraptor and even T.rex. So when I look at this specimen I don’t just see a baby ostrich, I see Struthiomimus. And what does the name Struthiomimus mean? OSTRICH MIMIC.”

    “You never forget your first living fossil. In my case, it was a Coelacanth preserved in a glass case at the Vancouver Aquarium. That it looked prehistoric was no surprise since it was supposed to have become extinct 65 million years ago. But in 1938 a living specimen was hauled from the depths of the Indian Ocean. In all that time it hadn’t changed much. Like the fossils of its ancestors it still had the fleshy limb-like fins that you’d expect to see on an animal in mid transition from water to land. But while it failed to evolve into a terrestrial creature – if in fact that was where it was heading - the Coelacanth succeeded in something even greater. It survived the second biggest extinction event on earth. Well done!”

    “In the darkest depths of the world’s oceans lurks a creature seemingly torn from the pages of a retro horror novel and with an appearance that would fit well within the real of science fiction - the Bone-Eating Worm!

    Their name is no misnomer, this deep-ocean organism (genus Osedax) preys exclusively on bones! While there is some debate as to the types of bones that they naturally consume, it is currently believed that these strange lifeforms primarily feast on the exposed bones of submerged, decomposing, whales.

    The bone-eating worm plays host to a symbiotic bacterial colony, residing in their roots, that produces an acid to tunnel through the densest of whalebone in search of the lipids they crave!

    Only discovered in February 2002 by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, they were found feasting on a grey whale at a depth of 2,893 m (9,491 ft)!”

    “From ‘Fisherman’s Fall’ by Roderick Haig-Brown, 1964

    'To some people, the thought that the salmon, all Pacific salmon of all species, die very soon after spawning is a depressing one. They see in it only decay and waste, a sort of pathetic frustration of life. This is a natural view, but it does not question deeply enough; the end of salmon is not death and corruption, but only fall, the autumn of their cycle.

    As the winds stir and drift the dying leaves, so the waters drift and stir the dying salmon against the gray-brown gravels of the stream beds. But under those gravels life is strong and secret and protected in the buried eggs, the real life of the race.

    In spring life will burst from the gravel as it bursts again from the trees, into the massive yield of the new cycle. Death is seldom more fleeting or more fertile than this.’”
