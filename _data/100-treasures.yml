- title: Krill; Euphausiacea; San Lucas, Baja, CA; Collected by M.H.N
  description: |
   We think of krill as that single pink cloud that moves in balletic undulations across the ocean in nature documentaries, sustenance for some of the largest inhabitants of this earth—baleen whales. But seeing each tiny droplet, with its two black pinprick eyes, lifeless and immobile in a specimen jar, is a very different way to view this keystone species. In an operation inverse but equal to the hi-res images that reveal the billions of stars that make up the Milky Way, it reminds us that ‘amorphous’ and 'anonymous’ are only a matter of perspective (as are their opposites), and that even the tiniest of creatures can make us feel small.

- title: Trilobite family; Redlichiida; 510-560 Ma; Ft. Steele, Cranbrook, BC
  description: |
    Redlichiida is an order of primitive trilobites appearing in the Lower Cambrian from 542-513 ma. Trilobites reproduced sexually with eggs developing in a brood pouch located on the cephalon (head). Redlichiidae are likely ancestral to all trilobite orders. The specimen was found in the Eager Formation, Burgess Shale.”

- title: John Davidson’s field kit; City of Vancouver Archives reference number AM505-S1- CVA 660-663; 1910; BC; Collected by John Davidson

    The image of John Davidson’s field kit is a self-contained and artfully composed process narrative. Looking at the trowel, hand lens, plant press, and other neatly arranged tools, we can easily imagine the botanist meticulously collecting, identifying, and pressing his buttercup for subsequent mounting and cataloging. The result of his diligence is a lovely herbarium specimen, preserved for future study.
    Having participated in collection forays with field botanists, I can attest to the fact that the modern-day botanist’s field kit has changed very little since Davidson’s time. The layperson’s field kit I carry when walking through the forest includes a hand lens, knife, jars for dead bugs, and paper lunch bags for collecting edible mushrooms and fern spores (to propagate). I also carry a phone and clip-on macro lens to take photos of plants and other life – today’s responsible collection method for the biologically curious hobbyist.
    We all carry a field kit of sorts, and that’s what gives this image universal appeal. The first punishment I remember receiving as a child of three or four years old happened because I rummaged through my mother’s handbag – her own urban field kit containing everything she needed for obtaining day-to-day goods and services for her family.
