Fungi are organisms with nuclei-containing cells that get their nutrients by breaking down organic material. Lichens are symbiotic associations between certain types of fungi and algae. The fungi are the structure ‘house’ and the algae make the food ‘chief’ by photosynthesizing.

The fungal and lichen collections contain roughly 70,000 specimens—45,000 lichens and 25,000 other fungi—but the diversity of fungi and lichens is only partly understood, even in the Lower Mainland, with many new species still to be discovered. The original herbarium was contained in a single file case, filed in packets, in the order they were added to the collection and an alphabetized list of cards directed one to each species/ or specimens. For many years the fungal collection grew under the care of Dr. Robert Bandoni, professor of botany from 1958 to 1989. Dr. Bandoni remained active in research for years after his retirement, and his collections will remain as a legacy of his dedication to understanding fungal diversity. Authorities on BC fungi, including Oldřiška Češková, Paul Kroeger, and members of the local Vancouver Mycological Society are actively building our collections. Some of the thousands of new specimens they have contributed are new records for the province. Others are undescribed, new to the world of science.

The collection of Agaricales (mushrooms) section has expanded rapidly in the recent years. The museum also has extensive holdings from the order Tremellales due to Dr. R.J. Bandoni’s interest and research in the group.
