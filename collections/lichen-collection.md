        description: Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichens in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream.

        description: Hypogymnia is a genus of foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. They are commonly known as tube lichens, bone lichens, or pillow lichens. Most species lack rhizines that are otherwise common in members of the Parmeliaceae, and have swollen lobes that are usually hollow..

Lichens are unique partnerships between fungi and algae. Lichens grow close to the ground and as a result they contribute important ecological functions in a number of terrestrial habitats, including many of BC’s forests. George Otto oversaw the UBC lichen collection in its early years, and since the late 1970s lichen curator Trevor Goward has contributed more than 16,000 specimens to this collection, including many new species. He has written extensively on the lichens of northwestern North America, with special emphasis on species restricted to old-growth rainforests.

We have a very solid macrolichen collection, with a strong focus on cyanolichens, especially the genus Peltigera. For this genus, at least, this is certainly the largest collection in North America. The collection is also strong in Calicioids as well as in other microlichen groups characteristic of old-growth forests. Taken as a whole, the collection is very strong on epiphytic lichens, and rather strong on terricolous lichens, especially macrolichens.

## Collection Scope
Of the entire lichen collection, 66% are from B.C., 12% are from the rest of Canada and the other 12% are from smaller collections from around the world.
