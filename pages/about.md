The Beaty Biodiversity Museum opened its doors in 2010 and UBC’s vast natural history collections were put on public display for the first time. The museum and its collections are the centrepiece of UBC’s Biodiversity Research Centre, which brings together the world-class researchers of the Biodiversity Research Centre and biological collections into one innovative complex dedicated to understanding and conserving the diversity of life on earth through research, education, and community programs.

## Vision
A world where biodiversity is better understood, valued, and protected.

## Mission
The Beaty Biodiversity Museum inspires an understanding of biodiversity, its origins, and importance to humans through collections-based research, education, exhibitions, and community engagement. As Vancouver’s natural history museum, we work to promote a greater sense of collective responsibility for the biodiversity of British Columbia, Canada, and the world.
