# The Structure of the Beaty Biodiversity Museum

Within the physical museum, specimens are organized under six collections, which may have smaller organizational components within them. This page will explain how the *digital* components (i.e. the components on this site) are organized.

## The Organizational Tree

Below is an overview of how the digital records are organized relative to each other at Beaty. 

```
|----- Beaty Biodiversity Museum
       |----- UBC Herbarium (Collection)
              |----- Algae (Dataset)
              |----- Bryophytes (Dataset)
              |----- Fungi (Dataset)
              |----- Lichen (Dataset)
              |----- Vascular Plants (Dataset)
       |----- Cowan Tetrapod Collection (Collection)
              |----- Birds (Dataset)
              |----- Herpetology (Dataset)
              |----- Mammals (Dataset)
       |----- Spencer Entomology Collection (Collection)
              |----- Spencer Entomology Collection (Dataset)
       |----- Fish Collection (Collection)
              |----- Fishes (Dataset)
       |----- Fossil Collection (Collection)
              |----- Fossils (Dataset)
       |----- Marine Invertebrate Collection (Collection)
              |----- Marine Invertebrates (Dataset)
```

## Collections

The [collections listed on this site](/collection/search) match the collections present in the museum. These collections have historical context for the museum and were started by specific curatorial staff. Collections vary widely in size and scope, and as such have varying staffing levels and total record counts. The Beaty museum has six collections in total, they are:

- The Spencer Entomology Collection
- The Fish Collection
- The Fossil Collection
- The UBC Herbarium
- The Marine Invertebrate Collection
- The Cowan Tetrapod Collection

All collections are managed in the Global Registry of Scientific Collections (or GRSciColl for short). Here they are kept in sync with various resources and identifiers, such as [Index Herbariorum](https://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/) and the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://gbif.org). All of the identifiers for a collection can be found at the bottom of its respective page, under the heading "Identifiers".

**Collection pages on this site can be used to:**
- View statistics on the entire collection
- Get high level contact and persistent identifiers in a scope that matches what is present at the physical museum.

Critically, "collections" *do not* directly hold any data. Rather, the data is held within datasets, which are explained below.

## Datasets

Within each collection, there is at least one dataset. Datasets are where information is further sub-cateogorized, made available for download, and assigned a [Digital Object Identifier (DOI)](https://www.doi.org/the-identifier/what-is-a-doi/). When you download specimen records as part of a dataset, you will receive a citation for that dataset *as it was at the point in time when you downloaded it*. This is critical, as datasets evolve overtime and referencing particular versions of datasets means that research maintains reproducibility. The Beaty Museum releases updates to datasets at regular intervals, and these are then pushed through the system until they are ultimately available here to end users. As mentioned above, for a specimen to exist on this site, it *must* exist within a dataset.

**Dataset pages on this site can be used to:**
- Download specimens in bulk and have a citation for that point of download
- See citations that have been made for specimens contained within the dataset
