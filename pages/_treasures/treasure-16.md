_Pseudohydnum gelatinosum_ is my favourite fungi to encounter on a fall mushroom walk through the lower mainland’s cool, wet, coastal forests. While most other fungi reflect the earthy tones of an autumnal colour palette, _Pseudohydnum gelatinosum_ is devoid of colour, translucent, filled with the soft light of cloudy skies filtered through hemlock needles. When dried, it is a less impressive specimen: a twisted, tanned skin of itself.

It is a jelly fungus, and, when fresh, has the texture and appearance of a lump of unflavoured gelatin. It invites you to touch it, the underside is wet velvet formed of innumerable, soft, spore-bearing teeth. One of its more evocative common names is the “cat’s tongue”. It is also known as the “toothed jelly fungus” or—as I learned from this project—the “great spirit gummy bear”. The specimen is a treasure, but the fresh fungus is a jewel for you to go out and discover: the silent tongues in the forest, the teeth that don’t bite, the mythical candy made of Vancouver rain.
