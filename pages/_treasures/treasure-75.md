“The preparatory of this iconic species of Hawaiian honeycreeper published Fifty Common Birds of Farm and Orchard, which sold 200,000 copies, in 1913. This publication caused Henshaw to be approached by Gilbert Grosvenor, who asked if Fifty Common Birds of Farm and Orchard could be printed in National Geographic. For over 100 years Henshaw’s original publication continues to be updated by numerous authors and is known as the ‘National Geographic Field Guide to Birds of North America.’”

Ildiko Szabo, Assistant Curator of Birds at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum.
