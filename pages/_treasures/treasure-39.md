“This tray of bones of the extinct Great Auk was the first specimen I handled at the museum. My task was to move it from a display case to a room for examination. I was all nerves; I imagined all of the possible ways I could muck up the task, fearing the terrible impression I would make on the museum’s Director and curatorial staff if I damaged these irreplaceable objects in any way.

Naturally, I executed the task with great care. I thoroughly washed and dried my hands, lifted the tray slowly, and walked in an exaggeratedly smooth manner, trying to float the bones down the hall, breathing a sigh of relief when I placed the tray down safely at its destination. I wished for a moment that the care I took in that act could somehow be retroactively applied to a time before the birds’ extinction.

Luckily, the very same building that preserves these bones is also a place that applies that care proactively every day. Whether through research, displays, or educational programs, it is the tireless work of these dedicated people that both inspires us and empowers us with the knowledge it takes to put this care into practice.”
