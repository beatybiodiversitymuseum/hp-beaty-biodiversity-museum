“When I see birds, I see dinosaurs. And that’s because birds aren’t just descended from dinosaurs, they ARE dinosaurs. Similarly to how humans are a specialized type of primate, birds are specialized type of dinosaur, and THAT IS AWESOME. It means that we have a contemporary reference point to better understand what is—almost inarguably—the most popular group of animals to have ever graced the planet. We’re starting to discover that so many of our favorite dinosaurs had feathers, including Velociraptor and even T.rex. So when I look at this specimen I don’t just see a baby ostrich, I see Struthiomimus. And what does the name Struthiomimus mean? OSTRICH MIMIC.”
