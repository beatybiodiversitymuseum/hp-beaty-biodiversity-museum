“In my eyes, there’s no animal that says ‘British Columbia’ more than the salmon. As a supporter of the Pacific Salmon Foundation AND a seasoned sportfisherman I’m passionate about making sure the delicate balance of sustaining this keystone species, while still being able to have some on our collective plates, is maintained. Over the decades the research that’s been done in this province and beyond has - and continues to - educate the policy that will hopefully ensure the salmon will be around for generations to come. Looking at this specimen in the collection brings me warm fuzzies every time.”
