“Every fall, rambling through woods and fields, and even my own backyard, I’m amazed to discover, yet again, the diversity of the fungal world. This time of year, fungi seem to pop up everywhere. And what a surprising range of shapes, sizes, colours, and textures they come in! These natural wonders must have struck a deep chord with the pioneering 19th century US mycologist, J.B. Ellis. For the study and collection of fungi became his life’s passion.”

With no formal training as a scientist, Ellis began, in 1878, ‘the distribution of a most important series of volumes containing authentic specimens of the fungi of North America.’ Working with his wife, Arvilla, and later, with colleagues such as B.M. Everhart, Ellis organized and prepared these reference sets, known as centuries (each one contained 100 fungal samples) and sent them to subscribers. Many botanists then 'availed themselves of the opportunity here afforded of securing excellent specimens of all groups of the fungi.’ An article published in 1898 in Science provides more background, and indicates that the works, prepared between 1878 – 1898, contained some 270,000 specimens!

Here at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum, we are lucky to have a set of specimens from the 2nd edition of Ellis and Everhart’s North American Fungi. The series, referred to as 'Fungi Columbiani,’ dates from 1894. Recently, Olivia Lee, from the museum’s herbarium, helped me to avail myself of the 'opportunity here afforded.’ As Olivia opened up the collection box, we found various treasures nestled between fragile papers, tucked into hand-folded envelopes (perhaps prepared by Mrs. Ellis herself!). We were intrigued how sample #204 (Polyporus hirsutus), collected by L.W. Nuttall in W. Virginia 'on dead limb of deciduous tree’ resembled turkey tail fungi found locally. And we marveled at how sample #205 (Polyporus cinnabarinus) still retained its intense cinnamon colour and felty texture. A yellowed pamphlet listed names of all 406 specimens included in the series. There was also a letter from Ottawa’s National Museum, dated 1963, which explained the transfer of the specimens to Dr. Wilfred Schofield at UBC.

For me, the mystery and beauty of these fungal specimens, along with learning about their history and the stories of the people associated with their discovery make spending time at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum such a wondrous experience. These museum treasures provide an amazing link to the past and also inspire me to learn more about my own backyard.“
