“This specimen resonates with me on many levels. First of all, the desert ecosystem found in the Osoyoos area is a national treasure in terms of biological diversity: many of our rarest species can be found there. In fact it has the dubious honour of being among the top three most endangered ecosystems in Canada. Although this particular specimen is from a protected area, the region in general needs much more habitat set aside to protect this biological diversity.

Secondly, I also work at a museum, and know the value of type specimens. They are essential to the science of describing new species, and housing them is one of the critical roles of natural history museums worldwide.

Thirdly, Dr. Geoff Scudder is a well-known expert in the study of Hemiptera (the true bugs), and he devoted both his career and even retirement to the identification and study of this interesting group of insects, including those housed at both the Beaty and the Royal BC Museum. It is his expertise that has provided both institutions with exceptionally well-curated collections.

And last but not least: I grew up in the Thompson-Okanagan and miss the scent of sage, the rolling hills dotted with Ponderosa Pines, and the song of the Western Meadowlark. When I look at this specimen all of these memories come flooding back.”
