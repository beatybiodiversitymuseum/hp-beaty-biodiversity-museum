“Affectionately called ‘Stumpy’ by museum staff and volunteers this magnificent western red cedar slab is one of the treasures of the Beaty Museum. While it has been part of the museum’s collection for the past 5 years, it has been a feature of UBC campus for more than half a century, spending time in the Biological Science building before arriving at the Beaty. The tree itself is believed to 775 years old when it was felled in the 1950’s. [More information on Stumpy’s life at UBC.](https://news.ubc.ca/2003/09/04/archive-ubcreports-2003-03sep04-stumpy/)

The Beaty’s collection of authentic objects makes the museum special and putting people in touch with these real specimens is a key part of our approach to teaching and learning. The impressive size and irresistibly tactile nature of this centuries old Western red cedar makes it a real treasure and valuable educational resource. Stumpy plays an important role in engaging our visitor’s hands, hearts and minds - inspiring young and old to feel the wood grain and rough bark, to count the tree rings, contemplate Stumpy’s long life, and reflect on their own lives and relationship with the natural world.”

Jackie Chambers, Education & Outreach Manager at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum.
