“The octopus genus _Argonauta_ (often called paper nautiluses) are named after explorers of Greek legends. To me, however, these animals are equal parts classic mythology and futuristic science fiction!

As a child I often dreamed of being able to fly, and I sometimes wonder of the ancestors of this group felt the same way. Most octopuses are built to live as bottom dwellers – they’re well adapted for crawling on the ocean floor, but they’re poor swimmers. Female paper nautiluses have developed a way to explore other parts of the water column. They can secrete hard, spiral shaped objects that were once thought to be the species’ egg cases. Scientists now believe that these objects are more like ‘ships.’ Paper nautiluses have been observed crawling inside these spirals, tipping them to the surface to trap air inside, and then using them to swim with neutral buoyancy at a variety of depths.

Male paper nautiluses do not produce these spiral vessels. To increase the chance of fertilizing a floating female, they have evolved detachable penises that can be ‘launched’ into the water and swim independently. Fire the torpedoes!

As a museum interpreter, I’ve met many people who are passionate about octopuses, but few have ever heard of the Argonaut group and their unusual abilities. I love sharing the unusual story behind this treasure when visitors explore our museum.”
