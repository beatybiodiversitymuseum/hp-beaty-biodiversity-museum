“Not your usual skunk, the Western Spotted Skunk is BC’s own, occurring nowhere else in Canada. They have the typical black and white colouration like all skunks, a warning to predators that they pack a stinky punch. Less than half the size of the more common Striped Skunk it also has a unique method for spraying. Rather than turning its back end towards a threat it does a handstand and tilts the business end (anal glands) towards the intended target. Thus it keeps the threat in view while getting in a good yoga session. This cute little guy was the unfortunate victim of a snap trap baited for rats but just as attractive to this small carnivore. It caught only his front right paw but his efforts to escape meant there was too much damage for rehabilitation. He was my first Spotted Skunk preparation, the first one the museum received since 1950, and he was nowhere near as stinky as a Striped Skunk.”
