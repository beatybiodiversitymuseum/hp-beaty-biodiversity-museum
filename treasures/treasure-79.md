“Seldom seen out of water, the Oregon spotted frog (Rana pretiosa) prefers the safety of the marsh. The highly aquatic amphibian ranges in colour, from a Kermit green to a dark brown, and has striking gold coloured eyes. Its body is designed to spend much of its life underwater, making these little guys excellent at hiding and difficult at seeking. Biologists often have to rely on detector dogs trained to pick up the particular scent of the Oregon spotted frog to locate individual frogs.

This precious frog is now the most endangered amphibian in Canada, with only three breeding populations left in British Columbia. Their decline is largely linked to the loss of over 86% of wetlands in the Fraser Valley – a large majority of which have been drained for human purposes, including agriculture and urban development.

The Oregon spotted frog is the ‘canary in the coal mine’ for ecosystem wetlands, changing climates and the growing numbers of wildlife that are threatened in British Columbia. It is a part of the fabric of BC’s natural heritage, but it is also one of the 1900 species at risk in a province with no endangered species legislation. Without a legal safety net to enforce protection and recovery of critical habitat, this precious frog will continue to slip from our sight.
