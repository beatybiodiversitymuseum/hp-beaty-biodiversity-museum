“Shown above is the latest in retro personal correspondence technology. Considered the antidote to modern day communicatory convenience and the saviour of Wite-Out manufacturers throughout the world, the Brother typewriter produces hard copies of emails once text is manually entered. This machine is also the originator of my personal favourite of the simulacra fonts, “Typewriter,” found in the Microsoft Word programs of today and adopted by millions of high school students attempting to add historical flair to their history essays. With its unique ability to make most correspondence appear written by Hunter S. Thompson after an evening of over-indulgence, the Brother typewriter is a well-used item among modern day scribes residing in their parent’s basements, pool houses, or in Portland.”
