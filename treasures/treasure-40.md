“Evolution is fun. Thinking and seeing evolution is like playing hide & seek with Nature….and certainly Nature knows best how to play. Who would ever thought about Dinosaurs were reptiles? Yes, and modern birds, which also lay eggs like all dinosaurs, are direct descendants of this separate group of reptiles that once roamed and dominated our Planet for 135 million years. It really is a wonder that modern Homo sapiens have been able to create museums, excavate and preserve things like this dinosaur egg for future generations, and to come to the conclusion that Nature is nothing but a small sample of Universal wonders ready for us to discover.”

Fernando Este, Librarian in Programming & Learning at the Vancouver Public Library.
