“The reason that this photograph is striking (besides the demographic monoculture that it displays) is because it was taken in 1951, the beginning of the 50th anniversary year of the founding of the Entomological Society of British Columbia. The ESBC was founded on 13 March 1902. The ESBC is still alive and kicking today, 64 years after this photograph was made and 113 years after the founding of our organization. We maintain strong and (substantially more) diverse membership, and we invite anyone interested in insects in the Pacific Northwest to join our organization. We publish a twice-annual online newsletter, Boreus. And we have been publishing a peer-reviewed journal – currently called the Journal of the Entomological Society of British Columbia – continually for almost as long as our society has been around.”
