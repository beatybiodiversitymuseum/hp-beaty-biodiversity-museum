“It was in the depth of winter that we first travelled to PEI to see if we could locate the remains of this whale. We all felt the sense of adventure of this big task but it was only when we unearthed the first bone - one of the giant shoulder blades stretching 5 feet across - that we began to understand the scale of our project. Over the next two years we devoted ourselves to prepare this specimen in such a way that would honour her in death by displaying how she would have lived in life.”
