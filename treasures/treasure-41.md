â€œWho wouldn`t be fascinated by a fish so oily that when dried and fitted with a wick it can be used as a candle? Or a fish so enigmatic that it can just disappear from long established spawning locations? Or a fish so mysterious that even its name is ambiguous?

The history and biology of eulachon, Thaleichthys pacificus, are intriguing. Among other names, eulachon are known as oolican, ooligan, hooligan, saviour or salvation fish and candlefish. They are a type of smelt, a small silvery anadromous fish, and are found only along part of the Pacific coast of North America.

Eulachon have always had special cultural significance in BC, and were used for many purposes. They were often the first fresh food source available in the spring, and both the fish and their prized grease were used as trade items throughout the province.

Their limited range and persnickety nature make eulachon a prime candidate for population decline, and in fact they have faced a coastwide decline for many generations. Eulachon are currently considered endangered in many parts of their range. Although their populations are defined by freshwater spawning location, this elusive little fish spends more than 95% of its life in the ocean. It is challenging to determine the causes of population declines and disappearances when we cannot track them for most of their life span.

We have yet to solve the many mysteries of the eulachon.
