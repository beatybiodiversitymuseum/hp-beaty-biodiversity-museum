“This picture of the Staghorn Coral brought back wonderful memories of a trip my husband and I took to Australia in 1976. We flew by helicopter from Gladstone over the Great Barrier Reef to Heron Island.

Heron Island is a true coral cay situated in the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef. The World Heritage Listed, Marine National Park is located there. Only thirty acres in size, the Island is surrounded by white sand. At low tide, with the aid of poles, we walked in amongst the beautiful coral to the edge of the island. At high tide we snorkeled around the island and viewed the ocean teeming with colourful tropical fish. We were blessed to have had such a delightful experience.

During our visit we discovered at the research centre that the coral reef was being attacked by Crown Of Thorn Sea Stars which were doing significant damage to the reef. In recent years rising water temperatures and ocean acidification are also damaging coral reefs around the world.

Australia has developed the largest Marine Reserve network in the world.

We hope people will soon learn to respect our oceans and the fascinating creatures like the Staghorn Coral who live there.

Happy birthday, UBC.”
