“Also known as the giant clam, this great mollusk gained notoriety through myth and legend mercilessly devouring unlucky divers. While today it is considered neither aggressive nor dangerous, its biggest battle is with overfishing as numbers diminish to near-extinct levels. As you marvel over its size and wavy contours, you can’t help but feel a deep and profound respect for the variety and creativity of life that nature has shown us.”
