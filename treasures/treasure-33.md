“Spiders. What a cringe-worthy subject. The worst is walking in the backyard of my apartment on a warm summer afternoon. Trying to avoid a spider web only to walk right into yet another.

So why jumping spiders?

***

I first met my boyfriend at a common friend’s birthday party. Maybe I "accidentally” took his beer. And then we spent the night dancing together. His move? Raising his arms up and down, and occasionally stepping to the right, and then left.

Okay, fine. He is not the best dancer. But somehow that left an impression.

It was not until a few months later that I found out he is a fan of nature documentaries. Through him, I learnt about these fascinating little guys, jumping spiders. With eight massive, hypnotizing eyes drawing your closer. Then, unannounced, launching toward the prey, a surprise attack.

But, they are also known for their skills in picking up mates, showing off all the dance moves when it comes to attracting the opposite sex. They wave their forelegs up and down, a few steps to the right, and then left.

Wait a minute. Wasn’t that how my boyfriend was dancing when we met?

Perhaps - it was the jumping spider I have fallen in love with?“
