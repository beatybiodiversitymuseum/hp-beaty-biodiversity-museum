“You can’t Google Huber Moore. Well, you can, but you won’t find anything about the local citizen scientist. You won’t find his incredible 35-year collection of plants and mosses. You won’t find the miscellany of boxes and jars used, creatively or economically, for safekeeping. And you can’t read handwritten notes showing his dedication and passion.

For now, the Huber Moore collection exists only in the hands of the Beaty Museum. There, Huber’s work shares his lifetime of observation, though failing eyesight means he can no longer see the collection himself.

The museum hopes to image the pieces, says Herbarium Manager Linda Jennings, and through magnification the museum can share it back with Huber-‘so he can once again enjoy his precious collections.’”
