“I was walking on campus one day, when I saw a Varied Thrush perched on a tree. Although I was new to North American birds, the gorgeous orange and black plumage gave its identity away. Since then, I have had several encounters with this bird, but one remains unforgettable: a Varied Thrush lying unmoving outside of my residence’s window. I was shocked to see this beautiful creature in such a state, and saddened that humanity has once again failed to harmonize with nature. Yet these incidents are also what encourage research and changes in society, in hopes to coexist with other organisms we share this planet with.”
