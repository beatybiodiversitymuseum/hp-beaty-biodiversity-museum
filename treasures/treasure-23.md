“I worked with this set of jaws a few years ago for a project called SeaLife, a photographic series focussed on the decline of the oceans. I included several shark specimens from the Beaty Biodiversity Museum collection to serve as symbols for the continued devastation of shark populations through overfishing and finning practices. Sadly these practices continue unabated and I am fearful of seeing the day when the preserved specimens and photographs of these creatures are all we have left.”
