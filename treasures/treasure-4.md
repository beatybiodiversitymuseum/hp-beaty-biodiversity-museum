“The image of John Davidson’s field kit is a self-contained and artfully composed process narrative. Looking at the trowel, hand lens, plant press, and other neatly arranged tools, we can easily imagine the botanist meticulously collecting, identifying, and pressing his buttercup for subsequent mounting and cataloging. The result of his diligence is a lovely herbarium specimen, preserved for future study.

Having participated in collection forays with field botanists, I can attest to the fact that the modern-day botanist’s field kit has changed very little since Davidson’s time. The layperson’s field kit I carry when walking through the forest includes a hand lens, knife, jars for dead bugs, and paper lunch bags for collecting edible mushrooms and fern spores (to propagate). I also carry a phone and clip-on macro lens to take photos of plants and other life – today’s responsible collection method for the biologically curious hobbyist.

We all carry a field kit of sorts, and that’s what gives this image universal appeal. The first punishment I remember receiving as a child of three or four years old happened because I rummaged through my mother’s handbag – her own urban field kit containing everything she needed for obtaining day-to-day goods and services for her family.

What’s in your field kit?”
