“The Vancouver City Museum was situated from 1905 to 1967 at the corner of Main and Hastings in the Carnegie Building. A museum of Vancouver’s history as well as BC’s natural history, it housed many bird, mammal, insect, and plant specimens from around the province. During the second world war, important specimens were moved to the basement for their safety and protection. In 1968, the majority of the collection was transported to a new site on False Creek, currently known as the Museum of Vancouver. However, some of the insect collection, including this moth, was moved instead to the Spencer Entomological Museum at UBC (now part of the Beaty Biodiversity Museum).”

Karen Needham, Assistant Curator of Entomology at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum.
