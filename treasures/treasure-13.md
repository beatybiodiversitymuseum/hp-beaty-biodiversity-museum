“You know, it’s a commonly held misbelief that the plural of octopus is octopi. In fact, the plural is octopuses. ‘pi’ as a suffix is Latin, whilst the root word 'octopus’ is Greek. Apparently it’s an etymological taboo to mix the two.

They’re exceedingly graceful, octopuses. I was surprised by this when I timidly held a baby octopus several years ago at the Vancouver Aquarium. Anything with eight legs was far too much like a spider, in my mind. But in reality, this was one of the most delicate, elegant animals I’d ever beheld. At full size, I imagine the Giant Pacific Octopus is like a shy, misunderstood monarch, secretly skirting the underwater walls beneath the Sea to Sky highway.”
