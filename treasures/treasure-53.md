“This beautiful Golden V kelp, Aureophycus aleuticus, was discovered in 2006 in the Islands of Four Mountains in the most north western part of Alaska in the Aleutian Islands, which it was named after. This species can grow to 9 feet long, and has such unique morphology and DNA, it was placed in its own unique family of kelp, the Aureophycaceae. It was described as new-to-science in 2008 and has provided scientists with a better understanding of the evolution of ocean kelp and in 2013 this species was a runner-up of the top 100 new species of the 21st century.”
