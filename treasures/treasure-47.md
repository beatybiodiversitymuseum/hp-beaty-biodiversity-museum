“Marrella splendens is the most common animal found in the Burgess Shale near Field, B.C.. Although it was initially described as an "odd” trilobite, Marrella was later assigned a class of its own. Complex morphology suggests it gave rise to shrimp, crab, and barnacles. Recently, Marrella has been proposed as the provincial fossil.“
