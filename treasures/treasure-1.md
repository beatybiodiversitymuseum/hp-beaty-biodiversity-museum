“We think of krill as that single pink cloud that moves in balletic undulations across the ocean in nature documentaries, sustenance for some of the largest inhabitants of this earth—baleen whales. But seeing each tiny droplet, with its two black pinprick eyes, lifeless and immobile in a specimen jar, is a very different way to view this keystone species. In an operation inverse but equal to the hi-res images that reveal the billions of stars that make up the Milky Way, it reminds us that ‘amorphous’ and 'anonymous’ are only a matter of perspective (as are their opposites), and that even the tiniest of creatures can make us feel small.”
