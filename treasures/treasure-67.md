“The wrinkled bark beetle is not a species you find unless you like looking inside moist rotting logs. I have only seen it once earlier this year sharing space with rove beetles, darkling beetles and click beetles among a myriad of other organisms. This photo highlights not only the beauty of beetles but also the value of collections and continued collecting. Two specimens of a species collected at the same location 60 years apart adds a wealth of data to our collective knowledge. We can learn about what species are, where they are, and how this changes over time as the environment changes around them.”
