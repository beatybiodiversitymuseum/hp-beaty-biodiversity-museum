“The Coho Salmon is a modestly-sized anadromous oncorhynchid that lives within the North Pacific rim of Asia and North America. Its life history involves a protracted freshwater phase, before going to sea, often living out its early existence in small streams, sloughs, beaver ponds and lake margins before emigrating to salt water as a smolt. Its marine period is usually about a year-and-a-half long before coming back to its natal watershed to spawn. In southwestern British Columbia, the Coho Salmon lives in the same lowland, mild-climate, valley-bottom ecosystems that we as humans use. Thus, Coho Salmon is a species of fish that provides us with a perfect indicator of our footprint impact in this part of our Province; its profound drop in population numbers, since European settlement, reflects the major, negative changes that we humans have done to our landscape in British Columbia.”
