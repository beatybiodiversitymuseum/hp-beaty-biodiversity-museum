“There is something incredibly captivating and humbling about the horseshoe crab. Commonplace to the point of seeming mundane, they are ancient creatures that have been on Earth two hundred times longer than the human species, with origins dating back as far as the beginnings of animal life!

Deceptively simple on the surface, what is revealed when you look under their shells, is remarkable. Their natural features include ten eyes, five pairs of walking legs, a heart half the length of their bodies, and baby blue blood that can save a person’s life. As someone who spends a lot of time thinking about creative technology, I’m blown away by the intricacy and innate extensibility of the crab’s form features.

Built for survival, they have been through four extinctions, and will probably continue to exist far beyond the limits of human civilization. If horseshoe crabs could speak, think of the amazing stories they could share!”
