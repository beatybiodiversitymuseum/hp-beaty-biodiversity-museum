“This specimen of _Pholis clemensi_ is a true treasure. Why? Because it is a “holotype” – the _original_ specimen used to describe this species as _new_ to science (in 1964 for _P. clemensi_). Holotypes are, therefore, fundamental to how we attach names to biodiversity and to monitor its persistence through time.”
