The ‘Speckled Dace’ is a small fish that, in Canada, only lives in the Kettle River. There is a major waterfall (Cascade Falls) just before the US border, and the Kettle River above the Cascade is the only place in Canada where you can find the Speckled Dace. It is not a big fish: the adults range from about 50 to 80 mm, and females are consistently larger than males. Breeding begins in mid-July and extends through August. Breeding females are quite drab but the males put on a colourful display. They develop bright red colours on their lower fins and on their lips. Some old timers call them the 'Lip Stick Fish.'”
