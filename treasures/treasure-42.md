“Mrs. W.W. Hippisley was the first female to make a significant contribution to the entomological knowledge of British Columbia. She lived in Terrace, BC, and in 1922 published ‘Notes on Northern British Columbia Coleoptera’ in the Canadian Entomologist. Then, in 1948 and 1949 (as Mrs. M. E. Clark), she produced the most extensive BC species list up until that time, containing 420 species of beetles, in the Proceedings of the Entomological Society of British Columbia. Many of her specimens came to reside at the Spencer Entomological Museum in the 1950’s.”

Karen Needham, Assistant Curator of Entomology at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum.
