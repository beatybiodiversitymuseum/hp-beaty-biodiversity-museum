“Wilfred Schofield was a leading world bryologist. His passion for field work, taxonomy, phytogeography, and describing new species, built the UBC bryophyte collection into one of the finest in North America. He was well respected over his long career and many genera and species were named in his honour.”

Dr. Judith A. Harpel, Curator of Bryophytes at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum.
