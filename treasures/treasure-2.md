“Redlichiida is an order of primitive trilobites appearing in the Lower Cambrian from 542-513 ma. Trilobites reproduced sexually with eggs developing in a brood pouch located on the cephalon (head). Redlichiidae are likely ancestral to all trilobite orders. The specimen was found in the Eager Formation, Burgess Shale.”
