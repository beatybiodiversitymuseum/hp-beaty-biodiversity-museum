“Redlichiida is an order of primitive trilobites appearing in the Lower Cambrian from 542-513 ma. Trilobites reproduced sexually with eggs developing in a brood pouch located on the cephalon (head). Redlichiidae are likely ancestral to all trilobite orders. The specimen was found in the Eager Formation, Burgess Shale.”

Dr. Kirsten Hodge, Curator of Pacific Museum of Earth.
