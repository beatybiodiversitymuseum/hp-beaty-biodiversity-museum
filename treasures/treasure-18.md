“I became seriously interested in dragonflies when I was asked to write the first book on the dragonflies of BC with Kathy Stuart, also a former curator of the Spencer Collection. My brothers soon picked up my passion for them, and we collected many throughout the province. Today, dragonflies are among the best known insects in BC; the Beaty Museum holds a significant collection of local species. These three specimens are from the Okanagan, the valley in which we grew up and to which we often returned.

Strikingly beautiful and easily identified, the Eight-spotted Skimmer is a common dragonfly of marshy places in southern British Columbia.”

Dr. Rob Cannings, Curator Emeritus of Entomology at the Royal BC Museum.
